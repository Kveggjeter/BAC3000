## About this project

This project is being worked on soley by me. This is my bachelor project and its being conducted under the auspices of [University of south-eastern Norway](https://www.usn.no/)
The finished project will be a automatic news-site that collects news articles from various sources, compiles and handles the information (with support of AI and webscraping) to georeference the article
to a map. Each article from around the world will be easily visualized with the intentions of broadening our perspectives on the news image around us. 

A desperate traditional media, which is being outcompeted by the new wave of digital/social media, post more tabloid and clickable articles for each coming day. That makes it difficult for each and everyone of us to 
follow the actual happenings around the world. When every frontpage is covering the American inaguration or Israel-Palestine, a lot of other important happenings around the world are given less attention. A map that visualize 
these happenings in a broader, geographical way aims to solve that.
